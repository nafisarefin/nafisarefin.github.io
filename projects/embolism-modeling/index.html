      <h1>CFD-Based Validated Emboli Tracking Study in a Patient-Specific Aorta During Cardiopulmonary Bypass</h1>

      <p>
        This research explores how emboli—tiny particles that can cause strokes or organ damage—move through the body during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), a common surgical technique used in open-heart procedures. By simulating patient-specific aortic anatomies, this work identifies how variations in blood flow can alter embolic risk in critical regions like the brain, kidneys, and liver. The goal is to support safer surgical planning through predictive modeling of embolus trajectories.
      </p>

      <p>
        A combined experimental and computational pipeline was developed, using a 3D-printed aorta model and mock circulatory loop for in vitro validation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted in OpenFOAM with Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) to model embolus movement under different CPB flow conditions. Outlet boundary conditions were tuned to replicate physiological flow splits, and flow validation was performed via flowmeter readings and dye-based tracer imaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project integrates skills in CT/MRI-based anatomical reconstruction, mesh generation, CFD solver configuration, and embolus transport analysis. The results show that embolic risk is strongly influenced by particle size, blood viscosity, and flow rate, with the Stokes number emerging as a reliable metric for trajectory prediction. This framework offers valuable insights for optimizing CPB surgical protocols and reducing embolic complications.
